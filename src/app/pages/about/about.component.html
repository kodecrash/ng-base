          So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter
          likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts
          for a type specimen book.

          Whether a medieval typesetter chose to garble a well-known (but non-Biblicalâ€”that would have been
          sacrilegious) text, or whether a quirk in the 1914 Loeb Edition inspired a graphic designer, it's admittedly
          an odd way for Cicero to sail into the 21st century.
